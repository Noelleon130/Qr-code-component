### What i learned
I learned the bacsic styling of the container components with the use of css flex box on how to position items on a web page in a mabnner that looks trractive to the viewers.
i also had to do an in depth view of css media querries that helped me undertand the media querry functionality used in achieving a mobile friendly version of my web page
@media (max-width:375px) {
  body{
    height: 100vh;
  }
  .container{
    width: 80%;
    margin: 25px;
  }
  
}
